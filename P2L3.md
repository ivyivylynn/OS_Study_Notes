# P2L3 PThreads 

PThreads == POSIX Threads
POSIX = Portable Operating System Interface

## 1. PThread Creation

```C
// Correspond to Birrell's Thread datatype
pthread_t aThread; // Pthread datatype

// Correspond to Birrell's Fork(proc, args) for thread creation

// pthread_attr_t is a data structure that holds information about - 
// certain things the thread manager should take into consideration -
// when schedule the thread 

// returns status representation about whether the creation was success or failure.
int pthread_create (pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, 
void * (*start_routine)(void *), void *arg)

// Correspond to Join(thread)

// status captures all relevant return information + results returned from the thread
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **status);

```

### 1.1 PThread Attributes

#### Attributes:
- stack size
- inheritance
- joinable
- scheduling policy
- priority
- system/process scope

The attributes have default values, if we pass in NULL for attr argument in pthread_create(), then the thread will be created with default values for its attributes.

PThread Attribute Interface
```C
int pthread_attr_init(pthread_attr_t *attr);
int pthread_attr_destroy(pthread_attr_t *attr);
// set or read a certain attribute value
pthread_attr_{set/get}{attribute};
```

- By default, when a child thread is created, it's a joinable thread. The parent can wait and join the child thread, hence reaping the child thread. 
- If the parent thread exits before joining its child threads, the child thread can become a zombie thread. After the child thread exits, it won't be reaped by its parent, so the memory assigned to it will not be freed.
- Detached thread
    - once detached, the thread cannot be joined
    - if a thread is detached, it will become equivalent to its parent thread
    - detached child thread can go on to execute after parent exit
```C
// to detach a thread
pthread_detach();
```
To create a thread as detached thread

```C
pthread_attr_setdetachstate(attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);

// ...

pthread_create(..., attr, ...)
```
For a thread to exit execution:
```C
pthread_exit();
```
Example to create detached thread:

- Note that the PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM means the newly created thread will share resources equally with all other threads in the system.
The create statement should be:
```C
pthread_create(&tid, &attr, foo, NULL);
```

### 1.2 Compile Pthreads
1. include header:
```C
#include <pthread.h>
```
2. Compile source with -lpthread or -pthread

```C
gcc -o main main.c -lpthread
gcc -o main main.c -pthread
```
3. Check return values of common functions

### 1.3 More Example

Note that in this program pArg is passed as a pointer to i, myNum can be tha value that i is when the child thread access it. It might have changed say from 1 to 2.
To correct this behavior, copy the i value each thread is supposed to take into a static array, then pass in pointers to array elements corresponding to each thread.

## 2. PThread Mutex

Pthread Mutex Syntax
```C
pthread_mutex_t aMutex; // mutex type
// lock operation
// explicit lock
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
// explicit unlock
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```

Other mutex operations

```C
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);
// mutex attributes specifies mutex behavior when a mutex is shared among processes
// the attr can be NULL, meaning follow the default behavior

// try to acquire the lock, if lock is free, then acquire it, if not it'll not block but return and 
// notify the calling thread that the mutex is not available
int pthread_mutex_trylock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

// free mutex data structure
int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```

## 3. Condition Variables
Basic PThread condition variable API:
```C
pthread_cond_t aCond; // type of cond variable
int pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);
int pthread_cond_broadcast(pthread_cond_t *cond);

```
Other condition variable operations:
```C
// initiate a condition variable with attr attributes.
int pthread_cond_init(pthread_cond_t *cond, const pthread_condattr_t *attr);
int pthread_cond_destroy(pthread_cond_t *cond);
```

Note here the mutex is first released then signal condition variables to avoid spurious wakeups.
