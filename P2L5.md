# P2L5 Thread Performance Consideration

## Goal:
- Performance Comparisons
    - multi-process
    - multi-threaded
    - event-driven
- Event-driven architectures
- Flash: Efficient and protable web server vs. Apache


## 1. How to compare models?

<img width="650" src="/images/P2L5/18aeabe6.png">
- For execution time(time it takes to process the same amount of job) pipeline model wins.
- For average time to complete order, Boss-Worker model wins.
- When making comparisons, what metrics we are considering if important.

### Are threads useful?
- who is asking? -- matrix multiplication application or a web service application?
- What do we care about?
- The answer is not that simple, it all depends
    - Depends on metrics
    - Depends on workload
    - Differen type of tasks (graphs, file patterns)

## 2. Multi-threading vs. Multi-Processing

### How to best provide concurrency?
- Context: web server
- Task: concurrent processing of client requests
- Multiprocess vs. Multithreaded

## 3. Event-Driven Model

### Concurrency in Event-Driven Model

<img width="650" src="/images/P2L5/023336c0.png">

- Even though there is only one execution context/ single thread, there are concurrent executions of multiple requests that are handled interleave.

### Why does this work?
- What is the benefit of having one thread switching between processing of different requests.
- How does this approach compare to assigning to different threads or even to different processes.

<img width="650" src="/images/P2L5/730a9f46.png">

- In single threaded event-driven model, it'll process the requests until idle is necessary then switch to another request, hence avoid unecessary context switching.
- If we have multiple CPUs, it still makes sense to use event-driven model especially when we have to handle more concurrent requests than the number of CPUs.
- Each CPU could host a single event-driven process and then handle multiple concurrent request within that one context (so that no context switch on the CPUs, reducing overhead).

- Jumping over the code base of the server

#### Problem with Event-Driven Model

<img width="650" src="/images/P2L5/08c498c9.png">

Solution: 

<img width="650" src="/images/P2L5/4673cac1.png">

- Only possible because the OS kernel itself is mult-threaded, so while the caller thread continues execution, another kernel thread does all the necessary work and waiting that's needed to perform the I/O operation
- Asynchronous I/O operation fits nicely with event-driven model
- Asynchronous calls may not always be available

<img width="650" src="/images/P2L5/8107f550.png">
Asymmetric Model:
- At the time the Flash paper is written, not all kernels are multi-processed, so they make the helpers processes.
- Asymmetric:  The helper side only deals with blocking I/O operations and the other side (upper side) deals with everything else.

**Asymmetric Model Benefits & Downsides:**
